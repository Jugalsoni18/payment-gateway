## Amount Storage

All amounts are stored in the **smallest currency unit** (paisa for INR):

- **Input**: â‚¹15.75
- **Stored**: 1575 (paisa)
- **Display**: Automatically converted back to â‚¹15.75

This ensures:
- âœ… No floating-point precision issues
- âœ… Accurate financial calculations
- âœ… Compliance with financial standards

## Integration Points

The logging system is automatically integrated with:

1. **Order Creation** - Logs when new orders are created
2. **UPI Callbacks** - Logs payment completions from UPI
3. **Webhook Events** - Logs all Razorpay webhook events
4. **Manual Operations** - Logs manual payment completions
5. **Status Updates** - Logs any status changes

## Performance Considerations

### Indexes
The system includes optimized indexes for:
- Order ID lookups
- Payment ID lookups
- Status filtering
- Method filtering
- Date range queries
- Customer email searches

### Automatic Cleanup
Consider implementing automatic cleanup for old logs:
```sql
DELETE FROM payment_logs 
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '2 years'
AND status IN ('created', 'failed');
```

## Security Features

- **IP Address Logging** - Tracks request origins
- **User Agent Logging** - Records client information
- **Webhook Deduplication** - Prevents duplicate processing
- **Data Encryption** - Sensitive data can be encrypted at rest

## Monitoring and Alerts

Set up monitoring for:
- High failure rates
- Unusual payment patterns
- Webhook processing delays
- Database performance

## Compliance

The logging system supports:
- **PCI DSS** compliance requirements
- **Financial audit** trails
- **Regulatory reporting**
- **Dispute resolution**

## Testing

Test the logging system with:
```bash
# Create order and check logs
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/payment/create-order \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"customerName":"Test","amount":10.50,...}'

# Check order logs
curl http://localhost:3000/api/payment/logs/ORD123

# Get summary
curl http://localhost:3000/api/payment/logs-summary
```

The Payment Logging System provides comprehensive audit trails and detailed insights into your payment operations while maintaining high performance and security standards.
