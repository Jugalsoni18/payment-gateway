# 🎉 Razorpay Webhook Implementation - COMPLETE!

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: FULLY FUNCTIONAL**

Your Razorpay webhook system is now **successfully implemented and tested**! Here's what we've accomplished:

---

## 🚀 **What's Been Implemented**

### **1. Secure Webhook Endpoint**
- **URL**: `POST /api/payment/webhook`
- **Security**: HMAC SHA256 signature verification
- **Raw Body Parsing**: Proper handling of webhook payloads
- **Event Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate webhook processing

### **2. Enhanced Database Schema**

#### **Orders Table (Enhanced)**
```sql
-- New fields added
webhookEventId VARCHAR(255)     -- For webhook deduplication
paymentMethod VARCHAR(255)      -- UPI, card, netbanking, etc.
paymentCapturedAt TIMESTAMP     -- When payment was captured
lastWebhookPayload JSONB        -- Complete webhook data for debugging
paymentStatus ENUM('pending', 'completed', 'failed', 'authorized', 'captured', 'refunded')
```

#### **Payments Table (New)**
```sql
-- Comprehensive payment tracking with 30+ fields
id UUID PRIMARY KEY
razorpayPaymentId VARCHAR(255)
razorpayOrderId VARCHAR(255)
orderId VARCHAR(255)            -- Links to Orders table
amount DECIMAL(10,2)
status ENUM('created', 'authorized', 'captured', 'refunded', 'failed', 'pending')
method VARCHAR(255)             -- Payment method (UPI, card, etc.)
-- Plus 20+ additional fields for complete payment tracking
```

### **3. Webhook Event Handlers**

#### **✅ payment.captured**
- Creates detailed Payment record
- Updates Order status to 'completed'
- Records capture timestamp and fees
- Stores complete payment method details

#### **✅ payment.failed**
- Creates Payment record with failure details
- Updates Order status to 'failed'
- Captures error codes and descriptions
- Records failure reasons and sources

#### **✅ payment.authorized**
- Handles payment authorization events
- Updates Order status to 'authorized'
- Records authorization timestamp

#### **✅ order.paid**
- Handles order completion events
- Ensures Order status consistency

### **4. Enhanced API Endpoints**

```bash
# Webhook endpoint
POST /api/payment/webhook

# Payment management
GET /api/payment/payment/:paymentId          # Get payment details
GET /api/payment/order/:orderId/payments     # Get all payments for order
GET /api/payment/enhanced-status/:orderId    # Enhanced status with webhook data
```

## 🧪 **Testing Results**

### **✅ Webhook Tests PASSED**
```
🧪 Testing payment.captured webhook...
✅ Payment captured webhook test passed

🧪 Testing payment.failed webhook...
✅ Payment failed webhook test passed
```

### **✅ Database Verification**
- Payment records created successfully
- Order status updated correctly
- Webhook event IDs stored for deduplication
- Complete payment lifecycle tracked

### **✅ Server Logs**
```
Processing payment.captured event: pay_test_1748091986005
Payment captured successfully: pay_test_1748091986005

Processing payment.failed event: pay_test_1748091986103
Payment failed processed: pay_test_1748091986103
```

## 🔧 **Configuration Required**

### **1. Environment Variables**
```env
RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here
```

### **2. Razorpay Dashboard Setup**
1. Go to Razorpay Dashboard > Settings > Webhooks
2. Create webhook: `https://yourdomain.com/api/payment/webhook`
3. Select events: `payment.captured`, `payment.failed`, `payment.authorized`, `order.paid`
4. Set webhook secret and update `.env`
